# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

## Introduction
This lab focuses on performing a multiple linear regression analysis using a dataset containing a small business's historical marketing promotion data. The objective is to estimate the sales from a combination of independent variables, such as TV, radio, and social media promotions. 

## Objectives
- To explore and clean the given dataset
- To identify independent variables for the analysis
- To create and fit a multiple linear regression model
- To interpret model outputs and communicate results

## Steps

### Data Exploration
- Load the dataset into a dataframe.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Visualize distributions of variables using plots.

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values.
- Identify outliers and decide how to handle them.

### Model Building
- Use plots and descriptive statistics to select independent variables.
- Fit a multiple linear regression model to the data.

### Checking Model Assumptions
- Check for linearity, independence, and normality.
- Verify the absence of multicollinearity.

### Interpretation of Results
- Interpret model outputs including coefficients and p-values.
- Communicate findings to stakeholders.
